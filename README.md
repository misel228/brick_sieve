# Brick Sieve
A sieve to pre-sort your Lego(TM) bricks from large to small.

![Sieve 8mm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misel228/brick_sieve/main/sieve_8mm.png "Sieve 8mm holes")

# Attention

I have not printed and tested them yet. The hole sizes need to be tested and evaluated

## How to use

Either print the STL directly or use the scad file in OpenScad and adapt to your needs.

The two most important variables are

sieve_size - the size of the holes in the bottom. Change this for which bricks you want to filter.
diameter - the outer diameter of the walls. Change thi to whatever your printer supports.

## ToDo

Print and try. Find out which hole sizes are the best.
